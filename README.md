# Surfs Up 

## Overview 
The project's goal is to support investment into a new business idea called "Surf n' Shake" that sells surfboards and ice cream in Oahu by analyzing weather data. The initial analysis focused on analyzing weather data such as precipitation and temperature in the last 12 months. The purpose of this project is to analyze temperature data for the months of June and December to determine if the business would be sustainable year-round. 

## Results
The temperature data from 2010 to 2017 for the months of June and December was analyzed as shown in the images below. (Please note the last date recorded in the data was August 23, 2017, so the December analysis excludes the year 2017.)
- The average temperature in June was 74.94°F while in December it was 71.04°F degrees. 
- The lowest temperature recorded in June was 64°F , while in December it was 56°F 
- The highest temperature recorded in June was 85°F , while in December it was 83°F

## Summary 
The results show that on average June and December have similiar temperatures which indicates that the Surf n' Shake shop could be sustainable year round based on temperature observations. Although the results look promising, more in-depth analysis on the weather data in June and December would help further support the question of year round sustainability.
- An additional query on precipitation data would help determine if the weather would be ideal for surfing and serving ice cream year round
- An additional query on the number of active stations during June and December would help determine the reliability of the weather data
